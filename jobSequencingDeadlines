jobList = ['Uber-Hotel', 'Lyft-Airport', 'Carpentry-Table', 'Uber-Hospital', 'Carpentry-Door', 'Lyft-Disney', 'Uber-School']
profitList = [200,390,100,800,590,400,620]
deadlineList = [2,3,2,4,5,6,1]

#Zip 3 lists into one list of tuples to sort
zipped = list(zip(jobList,profitList,deadlineList))
#Now sort descending order of profit
zipped.sort(reverse = True ,key = lambda x: x[1])
#Break zipped list into 3 individual lists
jobList,profitList,deadlineList = zip(*zipped)

newDead = dict{}
newDead.
newDead.append(deadlineList[0]) = jobList[0]
