'''
Given an array of numbers that repeat, find the single number that does not repeat
Assumptions:
1) Array of integers.
2) Repeating elements cannot repeat more than once.
3) 
Approach:
Iterate through every element and check if element exists in a "visited" list.
If it does not exist in the list, add it
IF it does exist in the list, remove it from there.
This will ensure that if element exists in list, one of 2 conditions is true:
a) Element has been encountered only once so far
'''
arr = [20,10,3,5,20,10,3,5,6,6,7]

def findOdd(arr):
  visited = list()
  for ele in arr:
    if ele in visited:
      visited.remove(ele)
    else:
      visited.append(ele)
  return visited

  print("Element occurring odd number of times:", findOdd(arr))
