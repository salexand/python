'''
Given a list of numbers and another shuffled list of numbers that is identical to the first except for a missing number, 
find the missing number
Assumptions:
1) Numbers are not sorted in either array
2) Array can be of any length
3) Only integers (negative and non-negative) in both arrays
4) Arrays can contain duplicates
Algorithm:
1) Concatenate both arrays
2) Initialize a variable to 0 and for each element in array, xor with this variable and store result in variable
3) Final value of variable at end of iteration is the missing number
'''

l1 = [100,90,80,30,200]
l2 = [200,30,100,90]

def xorFind(l1,l2):
  result = 0
  for ele in l1+l2:
    result = result ^ ele
  return result

def dictFind(l1,l2):
  l1D = dict()
  for ele in l1:
    l1D[ele] += 1
  for ele in l2:
    if l1D[ele] == 0:
      return ele
    else l1D[ele] -= 1
    INCOMPLETE
