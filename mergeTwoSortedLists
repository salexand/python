'''
Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a sorted array
Assumptions:
1) Arrays are non-empty
2) Arrays don't contain dupes (later on: enhance solution to take this into account)

Algo:
1) Iterate through array 1 and compare head of this array with head of 2nd array
2) Pop out smaller element into new array.
3) If elements are equal, pop them both into new array
4) Continue until array 1 is exhausted
5) Dump in all elements from array 2 into new array
