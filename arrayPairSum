'''
Given an array and a number, find all unique pairs in the array that add upto number
Algorithm:
Iterate through the array checking for each element if the 2nd addend exists in the array
If it does, put both numbers in a set. This will ensure unique values
'''

l1 = [-1,8,9,2,4,3,7,5]
numb = 7
# Create a new empty set which will hold answer pairs
outputSet = set()

def findAns(l1,sumVal):
  for ele in l1:
    # Create target number which when added to number currently seen from list will equal number to find
    addend2 = numb - ele
    # Check if this new number exists in the list
    if addend2 in l1:
      # Yes, it exists so save this answer by adding both numbers to output set
      outputSet.add((min(ele,addend2),max(ele,addend2)))
  return outputSet
  
print(findAns(l1,numb))
